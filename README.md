# YOLO vs YOLO-Pose Comparison Demo

This is a Streamlit web application that demonstrates the performance comparison between YOLOv8 base model and YOLOv8-Pose model for vape device detection.

## Features

- **Side-by-side comparison** of YOLOv8 vs YOLOv8-Pose models
- **Image processing** with real-time detection visualization
- **Video processing** with frame-by-frame analysis
- **Pose keypoint visualization** with skeleton overlay
- **Performance metrics** and comparison charts
- **Live camera simulation** for presentation purposes

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Access the demo:**
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`
